(1) The column names and table names are case-sensitive. [i.e "Age" and "agE" are considered two different column Names]
(2) Rows with null values are not inserted [just ignored, no exception is thrown]
(3) At Delete, if the Hashtable is empty, all records are deleted.
(4) At Update, if the input HashTable (input criteria) is empty, nothing is done and no exception is thrown.
(5) If a column in the Hashtable passed to either update or delete doesn't exist, an exception is thrown.
(6) If no records matching the input criteria in both update and delete, nothing is done and no exception is thrown.
(7) At Update, if strClusteringKey is null, an exception is thrown.
(8) At Insert, if the row to be inserted doesn't contain a value for the Clustering key, an exception is thrown.
(9) We placed the metadata file in the resources directory
(10) We placed the Data directory in the resources directory to store serialized pages and tables

(11) When calculating the middle value between two strings, we concatenate 'a's to the minimum string to equalise its length to the maximum string length to be able to use the recommended GeeksForGeeks algorithm. This would not change the actual minimum string.
